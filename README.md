# Hospital Patient Management System

A simple Java-based system to manage hospital and patient information. This project is designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and composition.

This project applies core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles including encapsulation to protect patient data and abstraction to hide complex hospital operations. It also uses classes and objects to model real-world entities like hospitals and patients


- **Hospital.java** – Manages hospital-related information and operations.
- **Patient.java** – Stores and handles patient-related data.

## 🚀 Features

- Add, update, and retrieve patient information
- Manage hospital records
- Object-oriented design with encapsulation
- Uses core Java Collections (e.g., `ArrayList`, `HashMap`)
- Console-based interface for simplicity and learning

### 🗃️ Collections:

- **`ArrayList<Patient>`**: To store a list of all patients.
- **`HashMap<String, Patient>`** *(optional)*: For quick lookup by patient ID or name.

## 🔧 Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Any text editor or IDE like IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VS Code
